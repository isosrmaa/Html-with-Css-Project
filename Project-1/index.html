                <h2>Founder Of Nation</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Prithvi Narayan Shah,</b>

                     born in 1723 in the small kingdom of Gorkha, is widely regarded as the "Founder of the Nation" in Nepal due to his instrumental role in unifying the country. His reign as the king of Gorkha began in 1743 when he was just 20 years old, and it marked the beginning of a significant era in Nepalese history.

During the 18th century, Nepal was fragmented into over 50 small states and principalities, including the three major kingdoms of Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur in the Kathmandu Valley, as well as numerous others like Lamjung, Kaski, and Palpa. This division made the region vulnerable to external threats, particularly from the British East India Company, which was expanding its influence in the Indian subcontinent. Prithvi Narayan Shah realized that only a united Nepal could resist these external pressures and create a stable, prosperous nation.

Prithvi Narayan Shah’s unification campaign began with the conquest of Nuwakot in 1744, a strategically important town located between Gorkha and the Kathmandu Valley. This victory gave him a crucial foothold and served as a launching pad for further military campaigns. He employed both diplomacy and warfare to gradually bring the neighboring states under his control. His strategic foresight was evident in his approach to alliances and his careful selection of battles, which minimized unnecessary losses while maximizing territorial gains.

One of the most significant achievements of Prithvi Narayan Shah was the capture of the Kathmandu Valley in 1769. This region was not only economically and culturally rich but also strategically vital for controlling the entire area. By bringing the three Malla kingdoms—Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur—under his rule, he effectively laid the cornerstone of a unified Nepal.

Prithvi Narayan Shah’s vision extended beyond military conquest. He sought to build a self-reliant and sovereign nation. He advocated for economic independence, emphasizing the need to protect Nepalese industries from foreign influence. He famously described Nepal as a “yam between two boulders,” referring to its geographical position between the powerful empires of China and India, and stressed the importance of maintaining good relations with both while ensuring Nepal’s sovereignty.

In his later years, Prithvi Narayan Shah laid down the policies and principles that would guide the future governance of Nepal. His Divya Upadesh (Divine Counsel) is a collection of his teachings and guidelines, emphasizing national unity, self-sufficiency, and cultural preservation.

By the time of his death in 1775, Prithvi Narayan Shah had transformed Nepal from a collection of small, fragmented states into a unified kingdom. His legacy as the architect of modern Nepal is deeply ingrained in the nation’s history, and he continues to be revered as a symbol of national unity and resilience.
